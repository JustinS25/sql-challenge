# sql-challenge

There were multiple goals for each step of this challenge. For the data modeling/engineering portion, the main goal was to read in the csv files in the "data" folder and create tables in sequel which included proper usage of primary/foreign keys, along with the correct usage of "NOT NULL" and data types. After creating these tables successfully with the provided constraints, the next step was to work on the data analysis portion. The main goal here was to write queries in sql to display the desired output tables. These new tables were created using concepts such as joining, subqueries, and wildcards, amongst several other strategies. 

Within this repository, you can find the code for the data modeling/engineering portion, which includes the .png file for the ERD located in the Data Modeling folder. I have also included a text file/sql file of how the tables were created with the help of QuickDBD.

As for the data analysis portion, the code is located within the EmployeeSQL folder as a .sql file. In this file, I have provided the proper pseudocode to give the desired table outputs.
